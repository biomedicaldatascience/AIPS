# AIPS
This is a novel distance-based approach, Ancestry Inference using Principal component analysis and Spatial analysis (AIPS) that incorporates an inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method from spatial analysis to assign individuals to population memberships. AIPS is an efficient R package to infer genetic ancestry of samples with unknown ancestry among closely related populations and to provide accurate estimates of ancestry for application to large-scale genome-wide association studies.
